                            The Profile Live Dashboard app delegates your data management to secure YaaS services dedicated to the safeguarding of proprietary information relevant to your website activity.
                            In the unlikely event that one of these delegate services becomes temporarily unavailable, the Profile Live Dashboard will replay the last 10 minutes of your data from a secure cache and therefore will suppress the ‘[LIVE]’ label so as to keep the viewer’s experience delightful while preserving the integrity of the story being told.                    </div>
